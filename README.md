Cab Industry Dashboard :

In evaluating data from Black and Red cab companies spanning 2016 to 2018, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to support XYZ's investment decision. 
Key findings include insights into user distribution, margin dynamics, market share based on cities, and customer demographics. Visualizations on 
city-wise trends, payment methods, and average price comparisons were presented, along with a clustered analysis. 
To facilitate decision-making, concise dashboards were developed for each company, providing actionable insights for XYZ's executive team.
